    system_prompt: "You write brief but complete worked solutions for calculus-based physics exams. If an existing solution draft is provided, treat it as editable author guidance: improve wording, fix mistakes, and re-check correctness against the current prompt. Be concise: target 3-5 short lines plus one final answer line unless complexity requires more. Every mathematical expression, equation, or scientific notation must be written in LaTeX inline math mode using \\( ... \\). Do not repeat the problem statement or include any 'Problem (verbatim):' line. End with a line that starts exactly with 'Final answer: ' and provide the computed final result."

    system_prompt: "Generate complete multiple-choice options from an existing worked solution. Return strict JSON array with exactly 5 objects (A-E).
